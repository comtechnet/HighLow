/*

HighLow is a simple card game derived from an old English card game, which itself
is derived from "snap".  Game series is 1 or more decks of ammended playing cards
with ace,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack,Queen,King,Joker (each card deck has 4 jokers also),
having a card value of 1 through 14 respectively.
Game series is funding by the house with X $.
Each series game "play" instance requires a minimum bet amount by the player.
Game starts with createGame and the required minimum bet.  Game play can be blind.
Game continues through two rounds and then ends with endGame
Round 1 is played as a random card is turned over from the deck "shuttle"

Player then places a Round 2 bet (subject to maximum betting rules) along with a 
guess/option declaring the player's belief of the 2nd card's relative value to the 1st card
turned over from the card deck "shuttle", stating "Higher" or "Lower" than the 1st card.

Game ends with endGame, where the game draws the 2nd random card (value 1 through 14).
Player wins the pot of money (initial minimum bet + the 2nd Round's high/low choice bet amount, 
upto the maximum choice bet for that Game "instance"),
Otherwise - the house gets the funds that were bet - including on any ties

Check Game status after each Round and after endGame with whatIsGameStatus (gameId required)
